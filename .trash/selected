I got this plant as a gift. I love it but I am clueless about its proper care and as a result it is dying. What am i doing wrong? I am watering it once a week and it gets some sunlight but not all of it. The wall is blocking the bottom half from getting any sun. Is that the problem? or should I change its soil? Also what is the name of the plant?

Thank you all in advance.

63,ricecrisps94,2020-04-19 00:32:24,"Composting for Beginners, Balcony Gardening /!/ Hi all,

I’m quarantined and have decided to extend my hobbies into gardening. I’ve always done it growing up but now that I’m working from home likely until June, I have lots of time I’m on my hands to start seeds and what not.

I’ve started tomato, potato, rosemary, basil, watermelon and radishes in my garden. But I thought, it would be nice to try composting to help reinvigorate the plants instead of fertilizers.

I was wondering if you all could give me some advice on composting, specially for a guy who has a small patio in LA. I don’t have a ton of money, but I have lots of banana peels, coffee grounds, egg shells, etc. Do I need to have a “compost starter” or can I just add in top soil instead? A general idea on dos and donts would greatly help.

I've found a lot of peppers in seed catalogues that are long and mildly hot and seem to match the description, but I'm wondering if there is a specific pepper that is most often used? I was about to buy Hot Portugal when I thought nah, I bet Reddit can solve this. 

Maybe it's more specific than just ""hot pepper"" in the Chinese?

I recently came into position of 20-something tiny succulents and live in the PNW.

I've been looking on overstock and amazon, and everything that's viable is over 60 bucks, and everything under is like a tiny tarp setup and while it would work, I'd rather get something more visually pleasing.

Ikea has the ""Socker"" for about 30 bucks after shipping and taxes, but I don't know how well that would work.

 I was wondering if anyone had any ideas for doing it even cheaper through DIY means! Has anyone ever made a DIY tiny greenhouse?

Note that the soil seems to be alkaline. I don't have a PH kit so I took a soil sample and poured some vinegar and started hearing fizzing sound which they say it means the soil is not acidic. I did the same with baking soda and didn't hear anything.

I water it once or twice a week, the soil seems to be dry most days, not damp.

I’ve been wondering how hard it would be to grow something like a fan palm where I live. The soil is pretty good, however I have various mimosa trees so would the roots hurt the palm trees growth?

On the other hand we get days in the winter that are well above 70 degrees and where the lows will be around 40-50 degrees. Sunshine is above average for the US, rainfall is average. The summers are sweltering with multiple days above 100 degrees, fairly high humidity and lows around 70.

I am a young, 2nd year gardener who needs help finding a resource that may not exist... A while back I was reading a website that said the best time to sow a specific annual veg seed (I can’t remember which!) was when the peonies started to bloom, as that indicated that the soil was the ideal temperature.

I was enchanted by this idea of using nature’s signs (robins retuning, daffodils sprouting, honeysuckle blooming, geese beginning to fly south, etc.) to determine when to sow annuals, transplant seedlings outdoors, etc. rather than just using the date suggested for your zone that doesn’t take yearly fluctuations into account. I feel like this must have been common folk knowledge at some point, but I have been unable to find any kind of guide/book/resource that uses these signs to give advice on when and how to garden, and I’m afraid I must just be looking in the wrong places or searchingly the wrong things.

257,greysmith,2020-02-05 22:01:06,"Looking for grass or plants that do well in dappled sunlight /!/ Hello r/gardening, 

My mother passed away last year and in her will she left me instructions to have her ashes buried in her back yard. I carried out her wishes, and for the remainder of last year I thought the spot was wonderful. Her garden has five large cherry trees that are huge and that keep the garden in the shade during the rainy season when the sky is barely visible through the folliage. 

But now the dry season is upon me, the cherry trees have lost most of their leaves, and the ground feels a little abandonned. I realize that grass that does well in shaded conditions is probably a pipe dream but I thought I would ask you guys if any of you had any experience or recommendations regarding plants that could do well under these conditions (heavy rainfall &amp; shade from June through November, strong sunlight the rest of the year.  May is the warmest month of the year. The temperature in May averages 21.7 °C | 71.1 °F. The lowest average temperatures in the year occur in January, when it is around 16.6 °C | 61.9 °F ).

Not necesarilly looking for a carefully manicured lawn. My mother liked this spot to be a little wild. I would just like to have a bit of greenery around her grave.

308,Dannei,2020-05-25 13:11:16,"Why are our bean plants dying off after being planted out? /!/ We planted out 20 or so bean plants that had been growing in pots in our greenhouse early last week. However, all have since died, with the plants being visibly unhealthy even after a day.

The plants were all growing vigorously whilst inside the greenhouse, so it's surprising that they took a turn for the bad so quickly! We're located in northern England, and there haven't been any nights below freezing lately - it's been a mix of hot and rainy days, with the plants being watered on warm days.

Images of a couple of plants and the growing area in the link below. There's not much signs of pests on most plants, though a few have had some leaf damage, likely from slugs or similar pests. The most obvious symptom was simply that the plants wilted. Were they simply not watered well enough after being planted out?

What could be the issue here? /!/ I planted a bunch of cherry tomato seeds in a large pot indoors with regular Miracle Gro Potting Mix. I've been watering them lightly about once a day.   


The saplings have reached this height and have stopped growing as rapidly as before. What could be the issue?

 [https://imgur.com/a/tuxinpn](https://imgur.com/a/tuxinpn) 

&amp;#x200B;

Here are my theories (from most likely to least likely):  


1) There are too many saplings crowded together. I need to move them to smaller pots so they can get plenty of nutrients.

2) I don't have pebbles in the bottom of the pot, so water is not draining properly. This causes root rot and over-moisture which prevents growth.

3) The soil I'm using (Miracle Gro Potting Mix - Yellow/Green bag) doesn't have the right nutrients for cherry tomatoes.

We have chickenwire fence or similar

Below that is another few inches of roots, give or take.

We have roots.

Hammers picks drills sledgehammers whatever -- don't easily penetrate 

I don't want the cinderblock-footed poles -- just too ugly 

I do have a type of metal stake that did seem to break thru

Separate all the seeds into their respective species by appearance, chill the seeds for a day or two in the fridge to simulate a cold season (which to my knowledge is recommended I think?) then plant each seed in it's own tiny plastic container with some soil. After a few weeks (or months), I'll identify what kind of trees I'm growing with the help of the internet and go from there.

So we had 11 tomato plants and at least as many pepper plants. Every single plant got blight. I noticed earlier in the season and tried my best to apply fungicide when I could, but it still ruined all of my peppers and harvesting and using my tomatoes was tricky. 

So my question is... thoughts on what I should do next year? The way my garden is set up, I dont believe there's any soil in any of the beds that won't be contaminated.

novice gardener here. A couple of months ago I found out about a myth of stones at the bottom of the pot. So after googling a little bit about that, I found Aeration stones that apparently help with:

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Aeration stones promote healthy root growth by creating air pockets in the soil and absorbing excess water in the basin of your planter. These porous clay stones are a natural, efficient and invaluable material to set your plant up for success.

After googling around I found no one mentioning these stones. So is this just a marketing scheme? or it actually works? How many of these stones do I need to put in a pot?

Thank you!

Note: this is cross-post from [https://www.reddit.com/r/Roses/comments/i47orp/several\_issues\_with\_new\_growth\_in\_double\_knockout/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Roses/comments/i47orp/several_issues_with_new_growth_in_double_knockout/)

I have several issues with my Double-Knockout Roses. I'm new with roses growing, so I'm sure I'm making many mistakes.

I leave in central Texas, and temperatures go above 100F these days. That's when I noticed strange behavior with new growth on my roses (see first 3 pictures bellow). I was googling and thought it's not enough watering I'm doing, so I started watering every day (sometimes skipping a day or two). It seems roses feel better, but still not significantly better. I'm thinking about installing irrigation system for the roses, as watering every day is just too time consuming. But before doing this, I want to understand if this is really a watering issue.

The issues are described in the images bellow, but just to highlight what I mean:

1. new leaves turn from red (normal) to dark green (bronze) instead of normal green
2. new leaves are curled
3. new bud stems look really strange
4. black spots on leaves (just noticed those, so will be googling about this)
5. in addition, flowers are really small if open. Buds were turning bronze (like leaves color I mentioned in #1) and often did not open. I think they started opening when I started watering more.

I'm fertilizing the roses about every 1-1.5 months now.

The roses were planted last fall, so it's around 9 months they live in my garden.

Any suggestions on what those issues can be? So I can at least google it. So far my googling is not very productive, probably because I even don't know what to name things.

Thank you in advance! I didn't find this community before, so I'll be now reading all you have here.

I've recently purchased a Compost bin along with my normal tumbler and I'm considering using it to rejuvenate my potting soil.

This is my first year doing a lot of potting with very large containers - 70G containers. 

I have a LOT of potting soil that I would rather not discard. I plan on adding heavy compost and worm castings to my large containers for next season, however, I would like to take the soil from my 5 gallon buckets and add it to my compost bin, let it sit over winter for use next spring.

I've had multiple people tell me it's dangerous because of possible disease in my potting soil and I should discard it, or use it for pollinators. 

I don't see why months of composting wouldn't kill pathogens and viruses in the soil, while rejuvenating nutrients. I'd like some opinions on that, as most of my experience has been with raised beds, and I haven't previously worried about this issue.

What is everyone's thoughts on this?

727,davmre,2020-10-18 00:13:29,"What's wrong with these blueberry bushes? /!/ I bought a couple of southern highbush blueberry bushes (Sunshine Blue and Biloxi) about a month ago and have been trying to grow them inside my urban apartment.  I have a full-spectrum grow light setup that produces a lot of light (around 30k lux at the top of the canopy) for twelve hours every day, which has been successfully growing a dwarf meyer lemon tree, so I was hoping it'd be enough for blueberries.

Both bushes came in 2 gallon pots; I repotted them in five-gallon bags with a mixture of acidic potting soil, peat moss, Down to Earth acid mix fertilizer, and some elemental sulphur. They looked green and happy at that point (first photo below). Even though the potting mix was supposed to be for acid-loving plants, it tested only around pH 6.5, so I've been trying to acidify it further, by watering about once per week (whenever the top couple of inches dries out) with a 0.01M water-sulfuric acid solution, which theoretically should have a pH of around 2.0. That seems to have brought the pH down to about 6.0 in some spots (though it's inconsistent and there are still areas that test at 7.0 or higher).

About a week in, some of the leaves on the Sunshine Blue plant (on the left in the photos) started turning brown and dying. I noticed a few spider mite webs and sprayed both plants thoroughly with insecticidal soap; I haven't seen any further evidence of spider mites since then.

Still, in the past few weeks the Sunshine Blue leaves have continued browning and falling off. Meanwhile, the upper leaves on the Biloxi plant have started curling upwards and drying out, with some lower leaves showing various shades of yellow and purple. It varies by branch---a few branches still look relatively healthy, and I've pruned some that were completely dead---but overall both bushes seem to be in bad shape. (second photo below)

Any idea what might be going wrong? I know that blueberries prefer soil pH in the 4.5-5.5 range, but would a pH of 6.5 (now closer to 6) kill them this quickly? Or is it that I'm trying to lower the pH too quickly? Or something else?

731,davmre,2020-10-18 00:08:32,"What's wrong with these blueberries? /!/ I bought a couple of southern highbush blueberry bushes (Sunshine Blue and Biloxi) about a month ago and have been trying to grow them inside my urban apartment.  I have a full-spectrum grow light setup that produces a lot of light (around 30k lux at the top of the canopy) for twelve hours every day, which has been successfully growing a dwarf meyer lemon tree, so I was hoping it'd be enough for blueberries.

Both bushes came in 2 gallon pots; I repotted them in five-gallon bags with a mixture of acidic potting soil, peat moss, Down to Earth acid mix fertilizer, and some elemental sulphur. They looked green and happy at that point (first photo below). Even though the potting mix was supposed to be for acid-loving plants, it tested only around pH 6.5, so I've been trying to acidify it further, by watering about once per week (whenever the top couple of inches dries out) with a 0.01M water-sulfuric acid solution, which theoretically should have a pH of around 2.0. That seems to have brought the pH down to about 6.0 in some spots (though it's inconsistent and there are still areas that test at 7.0 or higher).

About a week in, some of the leaves on the Sunshine Blue plant (on the left in the photos) started turning brown and dying. I noticed a few spider mite webs and sprayed both plants thoroughly with insecticidal soap; I haven't seen any further evidence of spider mites since then.

Still, in the past few weeks the Sunshine Blue leaves have continued browning and falling off. Meanwhile, the upper leaves on the Biloxi plant have started curling upwards and drying out, with some lower leaves showing various shades of yellow and purple. It varies by branch---a few branches still look relatively healthy, and I've pruned some that were completely dead---but overall both bushes seem to be in bad shape. (second photo below)

Any idea what might be going wrong? I know that blueberries prefer soil pH in the 4.5-5.5 range, but would a pH of 6.5 (now closer to 6) kill them this quickly? Or is it that I'm trying to lower the pH too quickly? Or something else? This is the second pair of blueberry bushes I've tried to grow this year, after the first died with similar symptoms --- please help!",https://www.reddit.com/r/gardening/comments/jd665a/whats_wrong_with_these_blueberries/,Reddit,gardening,False,None,None,None,None,,1,0,,https://www.reddit.com/r/gardening/comments/jd665a/whats_wrong_with_these_blueberries/,731

755,thevitaphonequeen,2020-10-17 21:33:19,"I’m a 1964 New York World’s Fair fan looking for a very special rose and a very special daylily. /!/ My father, who passed away in 2015, was a native of Long Island. His father helped with and worked at the 1964 New York World’s Fair, so my future father and his siblings got to go. So, naturally, I have a deep love of that World’s Fair.

In 1964, Jackson &amp; Perkins introduced a velvety red hybrid tea rose with the name 'World’s Fair Salute' (not to be confused with the 'World’s Fair' floribunda, introduced for the *1939* New York World’s Fair). It was their Rose of the Year for 1964. Sadly, J&amp;P no longer sells 'World’s Fair' or 'World’s Fair Salute'. 

Also, I was browsing garden.org a while ago when I came across a listing for a daylily called 'Worlds Fair'. (No apostrophe.) It was introduced by (I assume) Gilbert H. Wild &amp; Son in 1964, so it’s obvious which World’s Fair it’s named for. All I know is that the 'Worlds Fair' daylily was a “creamy yellow self”. I tried the Gilbert H. Wild &amp; Son website, but could not find that daylily. I couldn’t even find a photo of it anywhere on the 'net.

TL;DR: I love the 1964 New York World’s Fair, so does anyone know where I can find the 'World’s Fair Salute' hybrid tea rose or the 'Worlds Fair' daylily? (Or even the 'World’s Fair' floribunda rose, even though I’m not really as enamored of the 1939 NYWF?)",https://www.reddit.com/r/gardening/comments/jd3n7u/im_a_1964_new_york_worlds_fair_fan_looking_for_a/,Reddit,gardening,False,None,None,None,None,,1,6,,https://www.reddit.com/r/gardening/comments/jd3n7u/im_a_1964_new_york_worlds_fair_fan_looking_for_a/,755

859,REIGNx777,2020-11-23 00:37:14,"Looking for advice on filling raised beds w/out breaking the bank. /!/ Hi there,

I recently built 2 raised beds (4ft x 8ft x 1ft) in my backyard. I'm planning to grow vegetables in these beds, but am having trouble figuring out how to best fill the beds without it costing a fortune.

I'm in Zone 9b in California's Salinas valley (aka. the salad bowl of the world), so I feel like my ground soil is likely fairly good to grow in. I have a lot of extra soil in my backyard that I could easily fill the beds with, but I figure I probably need to add some compost and things like vermiculite/coconut coir in as well?

I've done a lot of research on soil mixtures etc., but am still kind of confused on what I actually *need* to make sure my beds are successful. I've seen a lot of talk about filling beds with 1/3 of compost, vermiculite and peat moss (or coconut coir). But to fill the 64 cu ft, that still seems quite costly (is this just due to the current demand for gardening supplies pushing costs up, seeing that 2 cu ft of vermiculite is $22/bag at Home Depot?)

If I followed that formula I'd need ~20 cu ft of each:

20 cu ft vermiculite (10 bags @ [$22/bag](https://www.homedepot.com/p/Vigoro-2-cu-ft-Organic-Vermiculite-Soil-Amendment-100521092/205655205)) = $220

20 cu ft compost (chicken manure) (20 bags @ [$3/bag](https://www.homedepot.com/p/Earthgro-1-cu-ft-Manure-71351180/100355799) = $60

20 cu ft peat moss (7 bags @ [$11/bag](https://www.homedepot.com/p/3-cu-ft-Peat-Moss-3001-CFC003P/205883917) = $77

Bringing it to a total of $357 to fill the beds before tax is factored in.

Strangely, it seems like the ""[ready-to-go mix](https://www.homedepot.com/p/Kellogg-Garden-Organics-2-cu-ft-Raised-Bed-and-Potting-Mix-Premium-Outdoor-Container-Mix-687/313340737)"" would be more cost effective, at $255 for 32 bags before tax.

Basically, I'm really just confused on how to go forward with filling my beds without wasting money. 

**I guess my basic question is as follows**: You have 64 cu ft that needs filling, a surplus of neutral pH soil (not sure on nitrogen content, as my backyard is just all dirt at the moment), and want to grow vegetables without breaking the bank.

870,January-Rain,2020-11-22 22:41:40,"When should I thin my flower seedlings, and how do I protect them from frost? /!/ This is my first time really gardening anything, so naturally, I have a few questions. 

I planted some bachelor's button and bright lights cosmos seeds two weeks ago. I made the mistake of not being careful when sowing my seeds, and they've sprouted quickly. There are some patches that are pretty dense, and not all of the seeds have sprouted yet. So I raise my first question: when should I thin the seedlings, and how should I do it to prevent damage to the other seedlings? Is it possible to replant thinned seedlings in a different (non-crowded) location if I am careful?

As for my second question, I'm in zone 9b and our winters are typically pretty mild. However, we have gotten frosts in the past winters, so I wanted to be ready just in case I see freezing temperatures in the forecast. I read that I should cover the seedlings with a blanket or sheet, but to stake it so the covering doesn't touch the seedlings. I'm not quite sure how to stake it like this, however - what should I use to stake it? And should I take off the covering first thing in the morning, or only once the temperatures rise again?

For Christmas I was gifted with some Nepenthes Sanguinea seeds and am very very excited to grow them! I have read they can be planted in mixtures of peat moss, coco coir, vermiculite or perlite, sand, etc. but to never use potting soil/mix. Unfortunately all I have at my disposal at the moment is perlite and vermiculite along with soil &amp; worm castings from my own yard, and some potting mix. What I want to know is if I'd be able to combine just the vermiculite and perlite, to create a growing medium for my seeds that they'll be happy in?  


I am eager to start growing my seeds but want to do it right, so if I end up having to wait to get proper soil/mix I definitely will.",https://www.reddit.com/r/gardening/comments/kmf37g/soil_for_growing_nepenthes_sanguinea/,Reddit,gardening,False,None,None,None,None,,1,6,,https://www.reddit.com/r/gardening/comments/kmf37g/soil_for_growing_nepenthes_sanguinea/,984

997,vsamma,2020-12-29 11:11:24,"Question about reviving mint plants /!/ Hi all, i’m new here.
But wanted some help.

A few months ago I bought some small mint plants in small pots and kept them on my balcony and watered them every couple of days.

I planned to replant them to a larger pot where they could grow within 15cm of each other. 
I know mint is an evasive plant so I thought that’s enough.

But I never got around to it and then the temp got cold and recently hit under 0 celsius.

At my parents house, the plants always survive the winter and grow again next year but I presume it’s not that easy with growing them in rather small pots.

So what should I do now? They’re quite dried if not dead already.

Should I just let them be through the winter and hope for the best in the spring that they will grow again?

Should I just bring them inside, cut off the dried parts and water them regularly and hope for the best?

Or replant them to that larger pot now with new soil and fertilizer (also cut off the dead/dried parts and water regularly)?
